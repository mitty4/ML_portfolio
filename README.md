### Welcome to my machine learning portfolio built with ReactJS, SASS, JavaScript, SQLite and deployed on AWS.

#### Parts:
The first page will showcase local weather predictions compared to my own predictions prompting viewers to observe the weather in the next few days to see which prediction produced better results.

Tabs will show different projects I have on display.

Colors: #cococo (accents), #444 (contrast), #fafafa (bg), #80ABF7 (primary), #c1d6fb (secondary)


<Project>; The View:

A summary of the metrics will be first for the viewer to see.

Six parts will tell the data's story from problem at hand, data collection/cleaning, data exploration, preprocessing, modeling and recap. These six parts will be shown graphically where possible.
